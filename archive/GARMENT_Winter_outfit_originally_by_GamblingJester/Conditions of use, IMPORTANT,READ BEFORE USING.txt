This outfit is not designed by me, I just remade it in VRoid, so it has some additional rules to respect the owners of the original design:

-While using this outfit you need to state that it is the [Happy happy halloween] Kirari Moroboshi Outfit from The Idolm@ster cinderella girls and credit me.

-You may not use this whole outfit as the main design of your model.

-You can however, use parts of it in your main design (the first rule still applies)
Warning: some items are not designed to be used individually because they have some parts erased to prevent clipping with other parts of the outfit.

Every rule from the document linked above still applies except the ones that contraddict these additional rules.


With that said, The Gambling Jester hopes you have fun with your brand new items!
